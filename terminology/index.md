> And the Lord God said, “It is not good that man should be alone;
> I will make him a helper comparable to him.”  
> Out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the air,
> and brought them to Adam to see what he would call them.
> And whatever Adam called each living creature, that was its name.  
> So Adam gave names to all cattle, to the birds of the air, and to every beast of the field.
> But for Adam there was not found a helper comparable to him.
