## Introduction

Here we take the perspective that any given system system is
a cluster of intelligence that can be meaningfully sliced into
smaller clusters of intelligence.
It helps if you have already had a look at [cdi&trade;](/cdi).

We also take the perspective that both data and algorithms are
pieces of intelligence that can be captured inside a computational system as knowledge.
Thus an integer is a piece of knowledge.
The algorithm to add two integers together is also a piece of knowledge.
Thus a class _number_ that contains an integer and the manipulations thereof
is a cluster of knowledge.
Now we can observe that both data and algorithms are ultimately knowledge and
are readily represented as data.
A _processor_ is the only thing that distinguishes between _data_ and _algotrithms_.
For humans, everything is thus knowldge.

The most fundamental and universal data structure is a tree.
Any arbitrary cluster of knowledge can be captured into
a tree of smaller clusters of knowledge.

A cluster of knowledge has a _root_ or a _handle_.
Any arbitrary graph of knowledge can be considered a cluster when you give
the cluster a _name_ — an _access point_ — which becomes its _root_.
Any given system can be defined in terms of:

* Micro Clusters of Knowledge (**KC**s)
* Cluster Access Points (**AP**s)

> Metaphorically, this is just a folder structure and pathnames.

A well-factored system is an organized breakdown of a resilient factoring of
system functionality driven by two principles:

* Single Responsibility Principle (**SRP**)
* Don't Repeat Yourself (**DRY**)

Inside this **KC** called [wfs&trade;](/wfs), we explore the ramifications of
this perspective.
