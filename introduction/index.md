## Introduction

Here we take the perspective that any given system system is
a cluster of intelligence that can be meaningfully sliced into
smaller clusters of intelligence.
It helps if you have already had a look at [cdi&trade;].

We also take the perspective that both data and algorithms are
pieces of intelligence that can be captured inside a computational system.
Thus an integer is a piece of intelligence.
The algorithm to add two integers together is also a piece of intelligence.
Thus a class _number_ that contains an integer and the manipulations thereof
is a cluster of intelligence.

The most fundamental and universal data structure is a tree.
Any arbitrary cluster of intelligence can be captured into
a tree of smaller clusters of intelligence.

A cluster of intelligence has a _root_ or a _handle_.
Any arbitrary graph of intelliegnce can be considered a cluster of intelligence
when you give the cluster a _name_ — an _access point_ which becomes its _root_.
Any given system can be defined in terms of _Micro Clusters (MC)_ and their
_Access Points (AP)_.

A well-factored system is an organized breakdown of a resilient factoring of
system functionality driven by two principles:

* Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
* Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)

Inside this _MC_ called _wfs&trade;_, we explore the ramifications of
this perspective.
